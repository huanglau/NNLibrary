# NeuralNetworkTutorials
Short tutorials basic neural network programming in Tensorflow.

The intention is to write short programs in ipython notebooks that implement a neural network concept in Tensorflow. Each notebook will contain one concept, and the concepts will be limited to those that can be reasonably completed in one notebook.

Each notebook should be a stand-alone, but some knowledge of machine learning concepts might be required. This is a reference for myself and for those who may find this code useful.
