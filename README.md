# NeuralNetworkTutorials
Short tutorials basic neural network programming in Tensorflow.

The intention is to write short programs in ipython notebooks that implement a neural network concept in Tensorflow. Each notebook will contain one concept, and the concepts will be limited to those that can be reasonably completed in one notebook.
